Based on the conversation, it seems the process being described is how to handle encrypted or protected emails in Outlook. Here is a summary of the key steps and details:

Process Description:
The process outlines how to view and save encrypted or protected emails received in Outlook. This is important to keep a record of the emails, as the sender (e.g. the state) may delete them after a certain time period (e.g. 30 days). Taking screenshots allows having a permanent copy for reference or documentation purposes, such as providing evidence in court.

High-Level Steps:
1. Identify that an email is encrypted or protected. This is indicated by text in the email like "encrypted message" or "protected message".
2. Open the email and click the link that says something like "Read secure message". 
3. If prompted, enter the login password for the encrypted server. A new password may need to be requested every 12 hours.
4. The encrypted message will open. Take a screenshot of the full message.
5. Forward the original email to yourself. 
6. Paste the screenshot into the forwarded email and send it to yourself.
7. The forwarded email with the screenshot will remain in your Sent folder for future reference.

Exception Handling:
- If you haven't logged into the encrypted server in the last 12 hours, you will be prompted for a password when trying to open the message. Request a new password, which will be emailed to you, enter it, and you will have access for another 12 hours.

Process Trigger:
The process is triggered whenever an encrypted or protected email is received in Outlook.

Additional Context:
- Printing the emails directly often results in problems or excess paper waste
- Saving as PDF has also had issues
- Screenshots have been the most reliable way to capture the full content
- The screenshots have been used as evidence submitted to court in the past
- The sender, in some cases the state agencies, delete emails after 30 days so having your own permanent copy is important
