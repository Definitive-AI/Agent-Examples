Here is the updated process description with a few additions:

Process Trigger:
The article writing process is triggered when the requester provides a topic, target keyphrase, key ideas to include, and a product page to link to as the solution.

Process Description:
The process involves taking a topic and key ideas provided by the requester and writing a 700-1000 word article optimized for a target SEO keyphrase. The writer first selects the primary keyphrase by comparing options on Google Trends to determine which has the highest interest over the past 90-360 days. 

The article is then written following a specific structure:
- Headline (50-65 characters)
- Intro paragraph (50-100 words) that uses the keyphrase in the first sentence 
- 3 subheadlines, each followed by 2-3 paragraphs (under 100 words each)
- 1-2 calls-to-action (to book a meeting or get a quote)
- Closing paragraph

The primary keyphrase is included in the title, 1 subheadline, 3x in the body text, the meta title, and meta description. Paragraphs are kept under 100 words with 250 words max between subheadlines. Sentences are varied in length but kept under 20 words in general, never exceeding 25 words. The article links out to a specific product page that should be mentioned as the solution.

10. Write third subheadline, including primary keyphrase
11. Write 2-3 paragraphs under third subheadline

Topic:
Multi-Platform RPA Management

Key ideas to include:
Traditionally automation companies have tried to lock you into using just their tech stack. As technology evolves ever faster the ability to use third party tools is more important.
Some customers have built many automations on one platform but want to use the new tools of another.
It used to be to change platforms you had to recode all of your automations
Now you can keep the old automations running and innovate on a new platform or new tools and coordinate the hand off of tasks from one system to the other with a Universal Orchestrator.
Multi-platform orchestration is cheaper than migrating your entire code base and more flexible.
Allows you to take advantage of mixing in low cost alternatives with your top self RPA tools.
